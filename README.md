## Project Overview

This project leverages state-of-the-art transformer models for text summarization, enabling users to generate concise summaries of lengthy text documents. The model is trained to identify the most relevant information in a text and summarize it in a coherent manner. The repository also includes deployment code that adheres to MLOps practices, ensuring a scalable and maintainable deployment pipeline.

## Model Architecture

The text summarization model is built using transformers, specifically the **[mention the specific transformer model used, e.g., BART, T5, etc.]**. Transformers have proven to be highly effective in natural language processing tasks, including summarization, due to their ability to understand context and generate coherent text.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShawneilRodrigues/Text-Summarizer-Project.git
   cd Text-Summarizer-Project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can start summarizing text by running:

```bash
python summarize.py --input_file <path_to_input_text_file> --output_file <path_to_output_summary_file>
```

Replace `<path_to_input_text_file>` and `<path_to_output_summary_file>` with the actual file paths.

## Deployment

The project includes deployment scripts that follow best practices in MLOps. The deployment process involves the following steps:

1. **Dockerization**: The application is containerized using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments.

2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD to automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrated monitoring and logging to track the performance of the deployed model and maintain the system.

To deploy the model:

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t text-summarization-app .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 text-summarization-app
   ```

3. Access the deployed model at `http://localhost:8000`.

## MLOps Practices

This project is designed with MLOps principles in mind to ensure reliable and scalable deployment. Key practices include:

- **Version Control**: All code, including model training and deployment scripts, is version-controlled using Git.
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests are automatically run during the CI pipeline.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**: GitHub Actions automate the pipeline from code changes to deployment.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrated solutions for tracking model performance post-deployment.
